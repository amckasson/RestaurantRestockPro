# Restaurant Restock Pro

## **Purpose**

**Restaurant Restock Pro** is an web application built out using *N-Tier Structure*. It allows *Users* to create, view, update and delete a *Restaurant Restock Order*. 
It allows users to Create a Restaurant. then a stock order, stock items, as well as setting the quantites for the order.  The purpose was when I worked in the restaurant industy
specifically when I was working in the kitchen; there was never a good way to do restock.  We always did it by pen and pad.  I wanted to make an app that allowed that process to 
be easier and more efficient.  Its not all the way complete; and though I created this for a final project at Eleven Fifty Academy I plan to continue working on it.  If only 
to continue to develop my skills using C#, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap.

I used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/HgoC4JyA/restaurant-restock-pro) to build out a board that easily allowed me to see what has been completed and what ticket tests I have yet to run.

I used [BD Diagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/60d48acddd6a5971481df6b5) to build out a visual representation of my database.  It was a helpful tool getting a wireframe put together at the start of the project.
